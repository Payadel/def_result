## Project Discontinuation Announcement

`def_result` will not be developed anymore.

Please use **[on_rails](https://github.com/Payadel/on_rails/)** library.

The **[on_rails](https://github.com/Payadel/on_rails/)** project is better and more complete than this project. In
addition to the features of this project, it has tools for railway oriented programming (ROP).

Thank you

## About

`def_result` is a library for **python**.

It is a library for functional error handling to improve **managing errors**.

It stores result of functions and provides a simple way to handle and manipulate the return values of functions, with
built-in support for error handling and more.

### Purpose

In functional programming, it is not always appropriate to use traditional `try-except` blocks because they can lead to
code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain.

The purpose of Functional Error Handling Libraries is to provide developers with a set of abstractions and tools for
managing errors in a functional way.

`def_result` is a functional error handling library. The goal of this library is to make error handling m**ore explicit,
composable, and testable**. By using this library, developers can write code that is **more robust, maintainable, and
expressive**.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this library is the desire to write code that is **more reliable, easier to understand, and less
prone to errors**. In many cases, functional programming languages provide built-in abstractions for handling errors.
However, for languages that do not have built-in support for functional error handling, libraries like this can provide
a useful alternative.

### What problems are solved?

This library can solve several problems, including:

- Ensuring that error handling is consistent across an application.
- Making it easier to test error handling code.
- Making error handling code more readable and maintainable.
- Encouraging developers to handle errors in a more functional way, which can lead to more reliable and robust code.

Developers can spend less time debugging and more time writing code that adds value to their organization. Additionally,
by using functional programming concepts, developers can write code that is easier to reason about and understand, which
can lead to faster development cycles and better quality code.

## Getting Started

Use `pip` to install package:

`pip install def_result`

## Usage

### Sample 1: use decorator for pure functions

In this example, `def_result` is used as a decorator to wrap the `divide_numbers` function.

```python
from def_result import def_result


@def_result
def divide_numbers(a: int, b: int):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b


result = divide_numbers(10, 0)

if result.success:
    print(f"Operation was successful: {result.value}")
else:
    print(f"Operation failed: {str(result.detail)}")
```

### Sample 2: use `Result` in function

```python
from def_result import Result
from def_result.ResultDetails.Errors import ValidationError


def divide_numbers(a: int, b: int):
    if b == 0:
        return Result.fail(ValidationError(message="Cannot divide by zero"))
    return Result.ok(a / b)


result = divide_numbers(10, 0)

if result.success:
    print(f"Operation was successful: {result.value}")
else:
    print(f"Operation failed:")
    print(str(result.detail))

```

## CHANGELOG

Please see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Payadel/def_result/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Features

- **Easy to use:** `def_result` is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a minimal API and clear documentation.
- **Compatibility with existing code:** `def_result` can be easily added to existing codes without the need for major
  refactoring. You can use decorator for wrap old functions or write new functions without worrying about
  incompatibilities.
- **Save any details you like:** Thanks to
  the [ResultDetail](https://github.com/Payadel/def_result/blob/main/def_result/ResultDetail.py) class, you can store
  various information about the output of the function. Also, by inheriting from this class, you can write new and
  customized classes for your project.
- **Special details for errors:** With
  the [ErrorDetail](https://github.com/Payadel/def_result/blob/main/def_result/ResultDetails/ErrorDetail.py) class, you
  can store specific details about errors. For example, this class supports **stack trace** in a built-in way.
- **Support for common details by default:**
  In [this link](https://github.com/Payadel/def_result/tree/main/def_result/ResultDetails), you can see the different
  types of details that are supported.

## FAQ

#### Do I need rewrite all the functions in a new way?

**not necessarily.** You can add this library and write new functions without changing the previous codes.

Also for old functions, you can use **decorator**. By using decorator, The output of the function is converted
to `Result` format. This way, your code is wrap in a `try-except` block to handle all exceptions.

#### How to manage all function exceptions?

By using decorator, your code is wrap in a `try-except` block and the final output is converted to Result. In this way,
all exceptions are handled.
